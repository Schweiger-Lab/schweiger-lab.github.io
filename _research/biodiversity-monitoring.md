## Project Overview

We have found evidence that the spectral similarity of plant communities scales with the similarity in plant community composition across many ecosystems. But how does community size influence this relationship? What is the "ideal" spatial resolution for remote sensing of plant diversity? What about understory plants? What about the diversity of other organisms? How can we integrate passive and active remote sensing methods, and environmental data to develop a remotely sensed biodiversity metric?
