## Project Overview

This project explores how spectral diversity measured from hyperspectral imagery relates to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity patterns. We use advanced remote sensing techniques to quantify plant functional diversity across different ecosystems.

## Objectives

1. Develop new spectral diversity indices for ecosystem monitoring
2. Validate spectral diversity metrics against field-measured biodiversity
3. Scale up findings to landscape-level ecosystem assessments
4. Create tools for conservation and management applications

## Methods

- Hyperspectral image analysis
- Field vegetation surveys
- Statistical modeling and machine learning
- Spatial analysis and GIS

## Current Status

The project is actively collecting field data and developing new analytical methods. We have established study sites across Montana and are collaborating with national partners to expand the geographic scope.

## Funding

This research is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF DEB-2234567).
