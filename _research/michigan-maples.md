## Project Overview

This innovative project investigates how plants communicate through chemical signals and how these interactions can be detected using advanced spectroscopic techniques.

## Research Questions

- Can we detect plant-to-plant chemical communication using spectroscopy?
- How do environmental stressors affect chemical signaling networks?
- What role does spectral reflectance play in plant communication?

## Methodology

- Controlled greenhouse experiments
- Field spectroscopy measurements
- Chemical analysis of plant volatiles
- Network analysis of plant interactions

## Expected Outcomes

This research will advance our understanding of plant communication and develop new remote sensing applications for detecting plant stress and interactions in natural ecosystems.
